You can use it at any point with the  command:>>> plt.style.use('mystyle-2.mplstyle')#### A1_mosaic_nostar.fitsoriginal image#### analysis_fullpicture.pyperforms convolutions on original image and get the mask out of it#### kernels.pymodule containing the kernels used for image processing#### locate_galaxies.pymodule containing the algorithm to cluster galaxies. The position of the galaxiesis saved in the folder located_galaxies_00/ in txt files. The txt files have thefollowing format.col     row       max brightness        number pixels in the cluster#### radius_analysis.pyTry obtain galaxy brightness using algorithm.#### mask.fitsmask which is 0 where there is no galaxy and 1 where galaxies were detected. Note,more white pixels can correspond to the same galaxy.
