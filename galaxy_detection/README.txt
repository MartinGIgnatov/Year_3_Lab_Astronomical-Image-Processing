Listing files in the folder#### mystyle-2.mplstylepersonal plotting style. You can use it at any point with the  command:>>> plt.style.use('mystyle-2.mplstyle')#### A1_mosaic_nostar.fitsoriginal image#### 0_convolution_and_mask.pyperforms convolutions on original image and get the mask out of it#### 1_cluster_galaxies.pymodule containing the algorithm to cluster galaxies. The position of the galaxiesis saved in the folder located_galaxies_00/ in txt files. The txt files have thefollowing format.col     row       max brightness        number pixels in the cluster#### 2_filter_galaxies_in_listdiscard galaxies from the list created by 1_cluster_galaxies.py according to criteria such as max and min pixel valuesand location.#### 3_adaptive_radius_photometry.pyevaluates the counts for every galaxy#### 4_incompleteness_analysis.pyapplies the above routines to a set of simulated data to estimate the performanceof the algorithm in terms of fraction of detected galaxies per flux count#### 5_final_analysis.pycounts reading are converted in magnitudes and monte carlo simulations are useed to find an estimate for the error in the histogram. The histogram is produced. Generallycontains the analysis part in the lab report.#### kernels.pymodule containing the kernels used for image processing#### radius_analysis.pyTry obtain galaxy brightness using algorithm.#### mask.fitsmask which is 0 where there is no galaxy and 1 where galaxies were detected. Note,more white pixels can correspond to the same galaxy.
